    <h1>DigitCyber</h1>
   <p>There are many upcoming programmers and bounty hunters who can not afford to enroll at Universities for programing courses in South Africa </p>
   <p>This website here will help them meet other programmers and bounty hunters who can help them start persuing their goals - Yes I am one of those disadvantaged programmers but I had to find a way here in DigitCode where I found websites such as <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">hackerone</a> ,<a href="https://github.com/">github</a> ,<a href="https://hackthebox.com/">hackthebox</a> and etc. </p>
